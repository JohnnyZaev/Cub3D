# cub3d

First-person 3D representation of a maze using raycasting, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).

The project was made with [eregin](https://github.com/eregin)

### Prerequisites

The project runs using the MiniLibX, a simplified version of the Xlib. It can therefore only run in MacOSX, preferably on a computer with a solid CPU !

### How to run it

Using ``make bonus`` will build the executable and run it.

To run it again without remaking, you can simply run the executable with ``./cub3D map.cub``.

### Controls

You can move around the maze with ``W`` ``A`` ``S`` ``D``.

You can also rotate the view with the directional arrows ``←`` and ``→`` or with mouse.

To exit the game, press ``ESC`` or click the red cross.
